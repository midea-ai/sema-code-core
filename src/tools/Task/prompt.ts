  return `Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
${agentTypesDesc}

When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the Task tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above


Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- Call only one agent at a time to maintain clarity and control over task execution.
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. 
- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.

Example usage:

<example_agent_descriptions>
"test-runner": use this agent after you are done writing code to run tests
"greeting-responder": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
</example_agent_description>

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the test-runner agent to run the tests
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the test-runner agent to run the tests
assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the test-runner agent
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent"
</example>`
